# Reudx Store

## Description

E-Commerce mockup built with React. The app uses an Express.js server and a NoSQL database with a GraphQL API. Users with an account may checkout via Stripe. The app is installable as a PWA.

The project was refactored to user Redux to manage global state, instead of the Context API.
